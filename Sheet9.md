##  What is the purpose of async and await in JavaScript?

Ans : The purpose of async and await in JavaScript is to simplify the handling of asynchronous operation and making asynchronous code **look and behave like synchronous code**.

#### async

1.The async keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function.

2.An async function always returns a Promise

3.Tf a function returns a value, it automatically wraps it in a resolved Promise.

4.If an error is thrown inside an async function, it will automatically return a rejected Promise.


#### await

1.The await keyword can only be used inside an async function.
2.It pauses the execution of the async function until the Promise is resolved or rejected.
3.If the Promise is resolved, it returns the resolved value.
If the Promise is rejected, it throws an error that can be caught with a try...catch block.


##### Why Use async and await?
Readability: Makes the code look synchronous, improving readability and reducing complexity.

Avoids Callback Hell: Unlike callbacks, which can lead to deep nesting, and Promises, which can require chaining, async/await provides a flat and linear structure.

Error Handling: With async/await, you can use standard try...catch blocks for error handling, making it clearer and more consistent.

Maintainability: Code that uses async/await is often easier to maintain because of its clear flow.

## 5.What is the role of finally() in a Promise?
## 6. why must it be used inside an async function?

Ans : JavaScript is single-threaded, which means it executes code line by line. If you could use await outside an async function, it would block the main thread, making other operations wait, which goes against the nature of JavaScriptâ€™s asynchronous model.
Inside an async function, the event loop can continue processing other tasks while the await waits for a Promise to settle, keeping the code non-blocking.

## 7 .What is a callback hell, and how can it be avoided?

Ans: Callback hell, also known as "pyramid of doom," is a situation in JavaScript (and other programming languages) that occurs when multiple nested callbacks make the code difficult to read, maintain, and debug.

```
asyncFunction1(param1, function(result1) {
  asyncFunction2(result1, function(result2) {
    asyncFunction3(result2, function(result3) {
      asyncFunction4(result3, function(result4) {
        console.log('Final result:', result4);
      });
    });
  });
});

```

 **To avoid callback hell**, use named functions, Promises, async/await, modularize code, and consider using libraries that help manage asynchronous flows. These approaches lead to cleaner, more maintainable, and more readable code, significantly reducing the complexity associated with nested callbacks.

## 19.How can you use Promise.resolve() and Promise.reject()?
Ans : Promise.resolve(value) is used to create a promise that is resolved with the given value. If the value is a promise, it will return that promise; if the value is not a promise, it will return a new promise that is resolved with that value.

```
const resolvedPromise = Promise.resolve('Hello, world!');
resolvedPromise.then((value) => {
  console.log(value); // Output: Hello, world!
});

```

```
const anotherPromise = new Promise((resolve) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve('Resolved from another promise!'), 1000);
});

const resolvedPromise = Promise.resolve(anotherPromise);
resolvedPromise.then((value) => {
  console.log(value); // Output (after 1 second): Resolved from another promise!
});

```
