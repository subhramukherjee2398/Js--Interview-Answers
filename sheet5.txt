1.What is DOM?

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects, where each element, attribute, and piece of content is a node in the tree. The DOM allows programming languages like JavaScript to access and manipulate the structure, style, and content of a document dynamically.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

Document: The HTML or XML document is represented as an object.
Object: Each part of the document (like an HTML element) is represented as an object, which can be accessed and manipulated.
Model: It models the structure of the document, making it possible to navigate and change the elements and content.

2.what is the difference between document and window?

document: It represents the entire HTML document.
window: It represents the current window.

3 What are DOM elements?

Ans : DOM elements, or Document Object Model elements, are the building blocks of a web page. The DOM is a programming interface provided by browsers that represents an HTML or XML document as a structured tree of nodes, where each node is an object representing a part of the document.

ex : <html>
<head>
<title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html>

4.How do you access elements in the DOM using JavaScript?

1.document.getElementById(id)
2.document.getElementsByClassName(className)
3.document.getElementsByTagName(tagName)
4.document.querySelector(selector)
5.document.querySelectorAll(selector)
6.element.children
7.element.parentNode
8.element.firstChild
9.element.lastChild
10.element.previousSibling
11.element.nextSibling
12.element.firstElementChild
13.element.lastElementChild

5.What is the difference between getElementById and getElementsByClassName?

Ans : getElementById() method is used to access a single element by its ID. getElementsByClassName() method is used to access multiple elements by their class name.

6.What is the difference between getElementsByTagName and querySelector?

Ans : getElementsByTagName() method is used to access multiple elements by their tag name. querySelector() method is used to access a single element by its CSS selector.

7.Difference betwen getElementsByClassName and querySelectorAll?

Ans : 

.getElementsByClassName(className)
Returns a live HTMLCollection of elements.
This means that if the document is updated and elements with that class name are added or removed, the collection will automatically update to reflect those changes.
.querySelectorAll(selector)
Returns a static NodeList of elements.
The NodeList does not automatically update if elements are added or removed from the document after it is created; it is a snapshot of elements matching the selector at the time it was called..

8.What is the difference between querySelector and getElementById?

.querySelector(selector)
Can select elements based on any valid CSS selector. It is very versatile and can be used with class names, IDs, tag names, attributes, pseudo-classes, or any combination of these.
Returns the first element that matches the specified CSS selector.

.getElementById(id)
Can only select an element based on its ID. It is a simpler and more efficient way to select an element than querySelector.
