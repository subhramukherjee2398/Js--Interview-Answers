## what is use of Ref?

Ans : In React, refs provide a way to directly access and interact with DOM elements.

To create a ref, use React.createRef() in class components or the useRef hook in functional components.


## How Virtual Dom works?

Ans : The **Virtual DOM** in React is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM, allowing React to optimize UI updates efficiently. Here’s how it works:

1. **Virtual DOM Creation**: When a React component renders, a virtual DOM is created as a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. This virtual DOM mirrors the structure and properties of the real DOM but doesn’t directly update it.

2. **State Changes and Diffing**: When the state or props of a component change, React creates a new virtual DOM. It then compares this new virtual DOM with the previous version to identify exactly what has changed. This process is called **diffing**.

3. **Efficient Updates (Reconciliation)**: React calculates the minimal changes required to update the real DOM based on differences between the old and new virtual DOMs. It then updates only the parts of the real DOM that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire UI.

4. **Batching and Optimization**: By updating only the necessary elements, the virtual DOM minimizes DOM manipulation, making updates faster and smoother.

This approach results in optimized performance, especially in complex UIs, since it avoids costly direct interactions with the real DOM.

## What is Diffing?

ANS : When the state or props of a component change, React creates a new virtual DOM. It then compares this new virtual DOM with the previous version to identify exactly what has changed. This process is called **diffing**.

## What is Reconciliation?

Ans : React calculates the minimal changes required to update the real DOM based on differences between the old and new virtual DOMs. It then updates only the parts of the real DOM that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire UI.


## What is strict mode in React?

Ans : Strict mode is a development feature that helps catch common bugs caused by using an outdated JavaScript feature.

StrictMode does not render any extra DOM elements. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants. These checks apply for development mode only. 


## Why should component names start with capital letter?

Ans : If you are rendering your component using JSX, the name of that component has to begin with a capital letter otherwise React will throw an error as an **unrecognized tag**. This convention is because **only HTML elements and SVG tags can begin with a lowercase letter**. 

You can define component class which name starts with lowercase letter, but when it's imported it should have capital letter. Here lowercase is fine:

While when **imported in another file it should start with capital letter**:

## What is the difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM? in a table?

Ans : Here's a comparison table highlighting the differences between the Real DOM and the Virtual DOM:

| Feature                | Real DOM                                   | Virtual DOM                               |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | The actual representation of the UI in the browser. | An in-memory representation of the Real DOM. |
| **Performance**        | Slower performance due to direct updates and re-rendering of the entire UI. | Faster performance, as it minimizes direct updates by calculating changes in memory first. |
| **Update Method**      | Updates involve direct manipulation of the DOM, which is time-consuming. | Updates occur through a diffing algorithm that calculates the minimal changes required. |
| **Re-rendering**       | Re-renders the entire UI on state changes, which can be inefficient. | Only re-renders the components that have changed, optimizing updates. |
| **Memory Usage**       | Higher memory usage due to the actual DOM structure and elements. | Lower memory usage, as it exists only in memory and is not a representation of the actual DOM. |
| **Interaction with UI**| Directly affects the UI, leading to potential layout thrashing. | Provides a smoother user experience by batching updates and minimizing layout recalculations. |
| **Implementation**     | Managed by the browser.                     | Managed by React (or other libraries using a virtual DOM). |

This table summarizes the key differences between the Real DOM and Virtual DOM, illustrating how React optimizes rendering and performance using the Virtual DOM.

## HTML event vs React event?


| Feature                     | HTML Events                                 | React Events                              |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **System**                  | Native DOM event system                    | Synthetic event system                    |
| **Event Naming**            | Lowercase (`onclick`)                      | CamelCase (`onClick`)                     |
| **Event Binding**           | Inline JS or global function               | Function reference within component scope |
| **Event Object**            | Automatically available                    | Synthetic event object                    |
| **Event Propagation**       | Directly on DOM, may cause performance issues | Uses event delegation for better performance |
