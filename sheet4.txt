1.difference between a function and a method

A function is a block of code that is executed when called. A method is a function that is associated with an object.

3.What is this keyword used for?

Ans: The this keyword in JavaScript refers to the current execution context.
The this keyword in JavaScript refers to the object that is currently executing the code. 
Its value changes based on how and where a function is called. It helps you access the properties and methods of the current object in different situations, like when using objects, constructors, or event handlers.

In simple terms, this points to "who" or "what" is calling the function.

4.What is Event Loop?

1.JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can execute one task at a time. However, it can handle asynchronous operations through an event-driven model.

2.When a JavaScript program runs, functions are pushed onto a call stack. When a function is called, it executes and then is popped off the stack when completed.

3.For asynchronous operations (like setTimeout, network requests, etc.), JavaScript utilizes Web APIs. These operations are handed off to the browser's APIs, which handle them outside the JavaScript engine.

4.Once an asynchronous operation is completed, its callback function is added to the callback queue/Task queue. This queue holds messages waiting to be processed.

5.The event loop continuously checks the call stack. If itâ€™s empty and there are tasks in the callback queue and processed to next step.

6.The event loop checks the microtask queue. If there are any microtasks, it will execute them all before moving to the next macrotask (ex: promise)

7.Once the microtask queue is empty, the event loop takes the next macrotask from the macrotask queue and executes it.

5.For of vs for in

1.for of is a loop that iterates over iterable objects (arrays, objects, etc.). It uses the iterator protocol to iterate over the elements of the object.

2.for in is a loop that iterates over properties of an object. It uses the for...in loop to iterate over the properties of an object.

6.what is Higher Order Function?

Ans : High-order functions (HOFs) in JavaScript are functions that do at least one of the following:

Take one or more functions as arguments.
Return a function as a result.
