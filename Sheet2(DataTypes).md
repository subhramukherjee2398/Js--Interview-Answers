# Data Types

## What is Data Type?

Ans : Data type is a classification of data that defines the kind of data and how it is stored in memory.

## What is the difference between primitive and reference data types?

Ans :

Primitive data types are the most basic data types in JavaScript. They are the building blocks of data and are used to represent simple values such as numbers, strings, and booleans.

Reference data types, on the other hand, are more complex data types that are used to store and manipulate larger amounts of data. They are typically implemented using pointers or references to memory locations.

## How Many Data types in JavaScript?

Ans : 1.Primitive data 2 .Non-Primitive data / Reference data Type

**Primitive data ( 7 types )** :

1.Number
2.String
3.Boolean
4.Undefined
5.Null
6.Symbol
7.BigInt

->They are called call by value.

->As they store in Stack memory.

->when we take the data, it is copied, so the changes are done on copied data.

**Non-Primitive data ( 3 types )** :

1.Object
2.Array
3.Function

-> They are called call by reference.

-> As they store in Heap memory.so they doesnot store the value instaed store the reference of the value.

-> Means whatever changes we are doing, we are doing in original value
